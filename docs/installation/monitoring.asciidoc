===== Monitoring with Netdata Cloud

PacketFence includes Netdata that is pre-installed and configured for most use-cases.

The metrics are displayed in 2 separate sections

* Dashboard: This section displays the metrics collected by pfstats for the unregistration/registration status of all nodes managed by PacketFence.
* Monitoring: This section displays system metrics collected by Netdata for the local host (standalone), or all hosts in a cluster.

All metrics are retained for a maximum of 28 days. Older metrics are automatically pruned to limit disk usage. To increase the retention rate edit the configuration and restart the service:

```
vi /usr/local/pf/conf/monitoring/netdata.conf

[db]
    retention = 2419200 # 28 days (seconds)
```

====== Dashboard

The dashboard diplays the metrics collected by pfstats for the unregistration/registration status of all nodes managed by PacketFence. These metrics are common across all cluster members, therefore a complete view is displayed from any host that is a member of the same cluster.

======= Monitoring

The monitoring section displays the metrics collected by netdata for the health of the system. Wether the setup is standalone, or a cluster, a section is dedicated to each host in the deployment. When using one host to view metrics from another, the external host must be up and running.

The User Interface (Web Admin) now includes:

* A duration selection that can be used to zoom-in/zoom-out the timeline, up to a maximum of 28 days. If the retention rate is increased, these selections will remain the same.
* A "Netdata Cloud" button that opens a new window with the Netdata UI. Once launched the user can login anonymously (bottom-right), or the session_id can be used to attach the PacketFence instance to the Netdata Cloud.
* A zoom-able popup that displays and compares a single metric for all members in the cluster. Click any metric title to open this popup.

To obtain the local Netdata random session identifier:

```
cat /usr/local/pf/var/netdata-lib/netdata_random_session_id
```

Once connected to Netdata Cloud, Netdata alerts will be sent to the email address used to register the Netdata Cloud account.

To attach all members of a cluster, each member has its own unique session id; where each must be used to login to Netdata Cloud manually.


===== Reatarting Service

```
systemctl restart packetfence-netdata
```
