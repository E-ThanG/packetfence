----
yum clean all --enablerepo=packetfence
yum update --enablerepo=packetfence

==== Debian-based systems

If `libmariadb-dev` is installed on your system at a version prior to 10.5.18, you will need to run following commands:

[source,bash]
----
apt update
apt install packetfence
apt autoremove
apt upgrade

In all other cases, you can simply run:

[source,bash]
----
apt update
apt upgrade

NOTE: In order to get `libmariadb-dev` package version, you can run following command: `dpkg -l | grep libmariadb-dev`.
If previous command doesn't return anything, `libmariadb-dev` is not installed.
