If you need to reboot a standalone server or a server from a cluster after services
have been stopped, make sure you set the systemd target to `multi-user.target`
before rebooting:

[source,bash]
----
systemctl set-default multi-user.target
----

This will make sure your services don't start up after the reboot. It's also the case for `packetfence-mariadb` service.

Set it back to previous target after it boots up:

.Cluster
[source,bash]
----
systemctl set-default packetfence-cluster.target
----

.Standalone
[source,bash]
----
systemctl set-default packetfence.target
----
